/*
* Write a method splitStack that takes a stack of integers as a parameter and
*  splits it into negatives and non-negatives. The numbers in the stack should
*  be rearranged so that all the negatives appear on the bottom of the stack
*  and all the non-negatives appear on the top. In other words, if after this
*  method is called you were to pop numbers off the stack, you would first
*  get all the nonnegative numbers and then get all the negative numbers.
*  It does not matter what order the numbers appear in as long as all the
* negatives appear lower in the stack than all the non-negatives.
* You may use a single queue as auxiliary storage.*/
