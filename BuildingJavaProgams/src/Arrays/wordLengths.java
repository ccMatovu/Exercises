* Write a method called wordLengths that accepts a Scanner representing an input
* file as its argument. Your method should read from the given file, count the
* number of letters in each token in the file, and output a result diagram of how
* many words contain each number of letters. Use tabs before the asterisks so that
*  they'll line up. If there are no words of a given length, omit that line from
* the output.*/
