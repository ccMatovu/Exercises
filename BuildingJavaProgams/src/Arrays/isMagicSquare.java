* Write a method called isMagicSquare that accepts a two-dimensional array of
*  integers as a parameter and returns true if it is a magic square.
* A square matrix is a magic square if it is square in shape (same number of rows
*  as columns, and every row the same length), and all of its row, column, and
* diagonal sums are equal. For example, [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]] is a
* magic square because all eight of the sums are exactly 15.*/
